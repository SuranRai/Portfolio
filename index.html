         <p> I am a passionate and driven Information Systems graduate with a deep love for coding and a relentless curiosity to explore the latest technologies. For me, coding is not just a skill it's a language through which I express creativity and problem-solving. What sets me apart is not just my technical proficiency but also my insatiable appetite for learning.
            The joy I find in coding goes beyond mere syntax and algorithms. It's about creating solutions that make a difference, be it streamlining processes, enhancing user experiences, or solving complex problems. With a combination of a solid academic foundation, expertise, passion, and a commitment to continuous learning I keep myself updated. I am currently doing a Web Development Bootcamp course in Udemy.
